## General
A Slider Carousel is a user interface component commonly used on websites and mobile applications to display multiple images or different content within a limited space on the screen. Typically, it consists of a series of items (e.g., images, titles, descriptions) stacked on top of each other, and users can navigate between them using buttons or slide indicators.

## Slider Carousel are often used to:-
- Showcase multiple images or content in a confined space: This helps optimize the website or app space and keeps it from becoming too heavy with content.
- Create an interactive experience: Users can switch between items in the Slider Carousel, creating an interactive and convenient user experience.
- Highlight important content: Slider Carousels are commonly used to highlight promotions, new products, or other important content.
- Popular libraries and frameworks like Bootstrap, Slick, and Swiper provide tools to easily integrate Slider Carousels into your website or application.

## Its benefits include:
- Lightweight, because there is no need to embed external libraries.
- Easy to edit and customize. Because it is not forced by the rules of the framework.
- And finally, it's easy to be creative.

## In this process:
- HTML is used to create content for the slider.
- CSS is used to create designs as well as animation effects.
- Javascript is used to execute user actions such as drag and drop and mouse clicks. In some special designs, javascript will also affect the design and animation.
